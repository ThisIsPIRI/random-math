# PIRI Web Timer
A simple timer, stopwatch and clock.

Note: if the last two microsecond digits never/rarely change and the clock mode shows UTC time instead of local time on Firefox-based browsers, try setting privacy.resistFingerprinting config to false.

## Dependencies
Requires Timekeeper.js and sound.js from [my JS Library](https://github.com/ThisIsPIRI/js-library). Already included.
